        <h3>The Mystery in Limoeiro Neighborhood 💀</h3>
        <div class="texto">
            
             <p>It was a sunny morning in the Limoeiro Neighborhood, and the Monica Gang was gathered at the field for another soccer game. Everything seemed normal until Cebolinha, with his always infallible plan, suggested they visit Chico Bento's farm for a surprise visit.</p>  
            <p>When they arrived, something strange caught their attention: the gate was open, and there was no sign of Chico. Monica, always the most sensible, suggested they go in to see if everything was alright. When they reached the porch of the house, they found Chico's grandmother, Dona Cotinha, crying inconsolably.</p>
            <p>-“What happened, Dona Cotinha?” Magali asked, concerned.</p>
            <p>-“It’s Chico, my dear... He... He was found lifeless by the river,” said the lady, through tears.</p>
            <p>The news shocked everyone. Monica, Cebolinha, Magali, and Cascão were in disbelief. Chico Bento, always so cheerful and full of life, was now dead. But what intrigued them the most was how it had happened. They decided they couldn’t let this pass without investigating.</p>

        <h3>The Investigation Begins 🔎</h3>
        <div class="texto">
            
            <p>Determined to uncover the truth, the group started investigating. First stop: the place where the body was found. On the way, Cebolinha, always attentive to details, noticed strange footprints along the trail.</p>
            <p>-“Look, guys! These footprints look different from ours,” he pointed out.</p>
            <p>-“That’s right! They’re bigger and deeper,” Cascão observed.</p>
            <p>Following the footprints led them to Nico Demo’s house, a boy known for his pranks and sometimes questionable behavior. Monica, determined to get to the bottom of the story, suggested they go there to ask if he knew anything.</p>
            <p>Nico Demo, when questioned, seemed nervous and contradictory. This raised even more suspicion, but without concrete evidence, they couldn’t accuse him directly.</p>
            <p>-“Let’s keep investigating, everyone. We can’t give up now,” said Monica, determined.</p>

        <h3>The Final Confrontation ❌</h3>
        <div class="texto">
           <p>Suspicions around Nico Demo were growing, and the Gang decided to dig deeper. During the investigation, they found a piece of Chico’s clothing at Nico’s house, stained with blood. It was the proof they needed, but they knew Nico was clever and dangerous.</p>
           <p>Monica and her friends devised a plan to confront Nico. They decided to lure him to the field, where they could have more control over the situation. When Nico arrived, they surrounded him.</p>
           <p>-“Enough with the lies, Nico! We know you killed Chico!” Monica shouted, holding the blood-stained piece of clothing.</p>
           <p>Nico Demo, seeing no way out, confessed:</p>
           <p>-“I didn’t mean to do it! It was an accident! I just wanted to scare him, but he fell and... and…”</p>
           <p>Monica, furious, lunged at Nico, but was held back by Cebolinha and Cascão.</p>
           <p>-“Justice needs to be served, but not like this,” said Cebolinha.</p>
           <p>With Nico in custody, the Limoeiro Neighborhood started returning to normal, though the loss of Chico Bento left a deep mark on everyone. The Monica Gang knew that despite everything, they had to move on and keep the memory of their dear friend alive.</p>
           <p>Thus, the mystery was solved, and justice was finally served. The Limoeiro Gang learned that even in the most difficult situations, unity and determination are essential to overcome any obstacle.</p>
